              <p>This website is an experiment to bring qualitative methods into an otherwise quantative web. Websites today are designed and created for an average user, something we want to change. If you look around you, you can see that everything has different models, sizes and designs in order to appeal to different types of people. Somehow websites are alone in the fact that they use one single model based on an average user for the whole world's population. Imagine if there were only one type of car model in the whole world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="large-4">
              <p>There are different types of people in the world who likes different things. And so we are trying to reach out to those people, not just the average one. By adapting and personalize the web depending on you, the user, we hope to improve the usability. The idea is to make it a smooth experience for the user by allowing for a quick and easy choice to customize their design. For this purpose we have chosen to team up with the validated qualitative method "Pick-a-mood".</p>
            </div>
            <div class="large-4">
              <p>For this experiment we are not basing the adaptation and personalization on a personality type, but rather the state of the user's current mood. We are not always feeling the same, we don't always want the same things. By choosing the mood we hope to appeal to how the users are feeling in the moment to always bring an up-to-date experience, that can vary from moment to moment. </p>

              <p>"Blue is the colour of the mind and is essentially soothing; it affects us mentally, rather than the physical reaction we have to red. Strong blues will stimulate clear thought and lighter, soft blues will calm the mind and aid concentration. Consequently it is serene and mentally calming. It is the colour of clear communication. Blue objects do not appear to be as close to us as red ones. Time and again in research, blue is the world's favourite colour. However, it can be perceived as cold, unemotional and unfriendly." -Angela Wright</p>
